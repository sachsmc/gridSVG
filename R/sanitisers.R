# Takes a grob name as an input and returns a selector capable of being
# used as a CSS selector in JS, e.g.:
# jQuery - $(...)
# D3 - d3.select(...)
# document.querySelector(...)
#
# Note though, document.getElementById() works *without* escaping.
#
# Mathias Bynens has written a *JS* implementation of this escaping which we
# could use for any JS code, but I think an R port is ideal. This is because
# we are not dependent on any external library, and the data is fixed. This
# means that it can easily be abstracted away for most purposes.

# escapeJS, if we want to have safe values for JS, we need to escape
